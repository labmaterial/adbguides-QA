# Provisioning an Autonomous VM Cluster on Exadata Cloud@Customer

## Introduction
Oracle Autonomous Database on Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer provides the benefits of a self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing database management system, bringing it closer to your applications on-premises while deployed securely behind your firewall. Setting up and using Autonomous databases on your Exadata Cloud@Customer consists of two steps

1. **Provision an Exadata Infrastructure**

    This step is common regardless wether you chose to deploy the Autonomous service using database 19c and above or co-managed Exadata Cloud @ Customer service using database 11g and above. To provision an Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer system, you must work with Oracle to set up and configure the system. **This step was completed in the previous lab**

2. **Provision an Autonomous VM Cluster on your Exadata Infrastructure**

    The type of VM Cluster you deploy on your Exadata Infrastrucure determines if its Autonomous  or co-managed. Once your Exadata Infrastruture is deployed and active, you may then create and Autonomous VM Cluster which runs your Autonomous Container Databases

**This lab guide explains steps to setup an Autonomous VM Cluster on your on-premises Exadata Cloud@Customer**

### Objectives

1. Create an Autonomous VM Cluster on a pre-provisioned Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.


### Required Artifacts
- An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account with a pre-provisioned instance of Exadata Infrastructure

Watch the video below for step by step directions on creating an Autonomous VM Cluster on your Exadata Infrastructure

## STEP 1: Create an Autonomous VM Cluster on your Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.

*Login to your OCI account as a fleet administrator*

Navigate to the 'Exadata Cloud@Customer' option in the top left hamburger menu from your OCI home screen.

Select 'Autonomous Exadata VM Clusters' from the menu on the left and click **Create VM Cluster** button

1. Choose a compartment to deploy the VM Cluster and provide a display name.

2. In the dropdown titled **Select Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure in CompartmentName**
    Pick the Exadata Infrastructure. Change the compartment if your Exadata Infrastructure was created in a different compartment than shown in the title

3. **VM Cluster Network:** Select a VM Cluster Network. Once again, ensure you change the compartment to where your VM Cluster is deployed

4. **Configure the Exadata Storage:** Optionally, you can Allocate Storage for Local Backups.

5. Choose the license type you wish to use. 
    **Bring your own license:** If you choose this option, make sure you have proper entitlements to use for new service instances that you create.
    **License included:** With this choice, the cost of the cloud service includes a license for the Database service

In the advanced options, you may pick a different timezone than the default UTC

Click **Create Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster**

Once created, your Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster is ready to deploy Autonomous Container Databases.

## Acknowledgements

*All Done! You have successfully setup your Autonomous VM Cluster on Exadata Cloud @ Customer environment. It is now ready to deploy Autonomous Container Databases*
